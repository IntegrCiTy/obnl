OBNL is a full python project thus as long as Python is installed on your
system you can install it by moving in the root folder (the folder this README
file should be) and run:

    python setup.py install

In some systems you need Administrator right to run this command.

Warning: OBNL requires these packages to be used in full:

 * pika
 * protobuf
 * connection-util (https://github.com/IntegrCiTy/connection-util)
